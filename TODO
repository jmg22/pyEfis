Get instruments to read Min and Max ranges, warning setpoints and other aux data
from the database.  This is working for gauges at the moment.  It still needs
to be added to the rest of the instruments.

Add screen sizes to configuration or screen def or something.  Still need to
figure this one out.  Do we allow multiple screens to be on the main window
at the same time or just duplicate information that we may want on multiple
screens?

Add flags to the instruments so they will indicate badness, oldness or failure

Clean up instruments

There is a funny border on the ALT and Airspeed tapes in Linux.  It's not
there on my Mac.  It might just be KDE too?

There is some weird race condition when the instruments fire up that they stay
failed and don't clear.  May have to do some locking in the database.

Need a diagnostic screen to show current status of the database and other
aspects of the program.

Handle Auxiliary data output.  This may not really be necessary for en EFIS but
it would make the client complete.

Move the code to Python 3
